In the busy life,we have countless trouble to solve .we struggle for life.and the life drives us to sacrifice our time to earn money to satisfy our enthusiasm for material .we dare not stay our step for our lust.we are always running in our own life ,however ,is that what we want?what are we living for?do we still have dreams?can weguarantee that we can smile to ourselfves and say to ourselves that we don't spend our life in vain proudly?


have we ever thought about such things which seems to be insignificance but in fact of great importance?so give ourselves some time,give ourselves an  answer,let's think about it carefully!


What life is ! what kind of life could be thought as a meaningful life ?Is life all about money and no ending of material enjoyment ! they all need our explosion!


I like a famous sentence in the movie Forrest Gump very much which goes that life is like a box of chocolate ,and you will never know what you are going to get! since the day when life is born ,the proposition of life for example,to be or not to be ,it is a question which will never disappears .people’s views clash from each other ,even l can bet when you ask one hundred of people about the meaning of life ,you may even get one hundred and one answers. 
It is just because Life is too mysterious to be expressed by words that it cause so many attentions .I used to think there is nothing but an awful song in the word but since step the  the door of college i know the meaning of true life  .life is just that you set a goal for yourself and when you sacrifice everything you can to accomplish it you can get great pleasure. in a word the meaning of life lie in the struggle for dream.


there is no doubt we can often hear a lot of people surrounding us complaining about how cruel life is and how unfair life is to them. But is it the truth I am afraid not ! in fact what we should do and the only thing we can do facing now  the dog_eat_dog society is spare no effort to study and develop ourselves to guarantee us to have an advantage over others rather spend our parents’ money and compliant about life.


If you are still confused about life ,I can give you a suggestion, have a close look at you parents you will know the meaning of life and what you should know!
